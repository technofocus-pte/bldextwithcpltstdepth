# Lab 06 - Create a Knowledge Assistant agent for HR in Copilot Studio that leverages Azure AI Search

## Objective:

A large enterprise wants to reduce the time employees spend searching
for HR-related information (policies, benefits, leave guidelines, etc.)
spread across SharePoint, PDFs, internal wikis, and documents.

To overcome this issue, in this lab, you will build a **Knowledge
assistant** **agent** in **Copilot Studio** that uses **Azure AI
Search**, to index and semantically search across enterprise HR
documents.

## Exercise 1: Create an Azure AI Search resource

In this exercise, you will create an Azure AI Search resource from the Azure portal. This will be used to search the documents using AI capability.

**Azure AI Search** is a cloud-based service for searching within your privately curated data. It uses a combination of Microsoft’s AI and JSON-based indexes to provide fast, relevant search results.

1.  Open a browser and login to Azure portal at +++https://portal.azure.com/+++ with your credentials.

    -    Username - +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username+++
    
    -    Password - +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Password+++

    From the Home page of the Azure portal, select **Microsoft Foundry** and select **Microsoft Foundry** under Services.
